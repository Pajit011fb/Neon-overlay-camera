# Neon-overlay-camera
This is my first project . I took some help with ai . It took 10 day to complete it . Please give feedback back
you can use this app to see where should you fit you neon sign board and how it will look after fitting .
we can akso use 3d model and render it over camera view with the gelp of three.js and other stuff but it gone a take lot of time in dev as i have to render the 3d asset on backend .
